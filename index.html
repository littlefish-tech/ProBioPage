          My name is Yimeng Yu and I am currently enrolled at UC Berkeley Full Stack Developer Boot Camp. This the third month now since the boot camp started. I have learned a lot during these three months. I am spending long hours learning and reviewing course materials every day, but I feel all my efforts are worthwhile. I can build more and more applications now.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          When I have time, I like to reading books, learning new technologies, playing with my son and cooking for my family. Technology is changing everyday.  Since I am live in Silicon Valley, most news around me are about the newest technologies, and people around me are talking about the new technology.

        </p>

          I like to cook, and I started to learn about cooking when I was very young. When I was very young, my parents are very busy, and they didn't have time to cook for me, but I did not like to buy meals outside, so I decided to learn myself. I like to create new kinds of dishes: it is fun and I can try the new taste with all different combinations. Now, I know how to cook Asian food, Italian food, and a lot of my creations are Asian food and italian food combination. The creation process is a lot of fun!!!

          Now is my third month and UC Berkeley Boot Camp. One of the unforgettable experience is the team project. For me, this is not only the project, this is only about the teamwork and collaboration. We all contribute our ideas, and we filter out some ideas which are not workable. Once we make our decision about the topic for the group, each individual has a component that we can work on on our own, but we also ask for help from our teammates if needed. Working individually is very important, since we can all have something we focus on, and the process to work on our little piece is an important learning process. When any memebr needs any help, each member tries their best to help, and this is a good process to learn from each other.


        </p>
        <p>
          I am very excited about my career transition to become a full stack developer.
