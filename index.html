          My name is Yimeng Yu and I am currently enrolled at UC Berkeley Full Stack Boot Camp. This the third month now since the boot camp starts. I have learned a lot during the 3 month. I am spending very long hours on learning and reviewing course materials everyday, but I feel all my efforts are worthing. I can build more and more applications now.
